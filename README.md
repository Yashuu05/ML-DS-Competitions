# 🧠 Machine Learning & Data Science Competitions

This repository serves as a **central collection of my work from various machine learning and data science competitions** participated in across platforms such as **Kaggle** and other organizations.

Each competition is organized in its **own dedicated folder**, containing notebooks, trained models, outputs, and supporting files related to that specific challenge.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Practice real-world **machine learning problem-solving**
  
- Apply concepts such as:
  - Data preprocessing & feature engineering
  - Model selection & evaluation
  - Hyperparameter tuning
  - ML pipelines
  
- Build a **structured and reproducible portfolio** of competition work

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - pandas, numpy  
  - scikit-learn  
  - XGBoost, LightGBM  
  - matplotlib, seaborn (where applicable)  

---

## 📌 Notes

- Each competition folder includes its **own README** describing:
  - Problem statement
  - Dataset overview
  - Approach and methodology
  - Models used and results
- Code is written for **learning, experimentation, and reproducibility**
- Datasets follow competition usage rules and licenses.
